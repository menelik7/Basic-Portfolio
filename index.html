		            <p>I am originally from Ethiopia and have been living in the U.S. for 12 years.  I currently work as a Project Engineer at Benchmark management LLC, mainly managing vertical construciton projects.  My job is highly demanding, often-times stressful, and requires a good deal of time management.  I enjoy what I do, but it does not offer opportunities to be genuinely creative.</p>  
		            <p>I have been fascinated with software development dating back to the first time I was introduced to the Commodore 64.  The manual included pre-written programs.  One rendered miniature hot-air ballons flying across the screen in random directions, and the other was a segment of a musical keyboard.  The rush when the code works is indescribable.  The fantasy of getting there is even more addictive.  I have finally surrendered to my passion.</p>
